# homebrew-octave-app

Homebrew formulae for Octave.app.

This is the tap for the [Octave.app project](https://github.com/octave-app), which bundles GNU Octave into a macOS Octave.app app bundle.

These formulae are intended primarily for use in the bundled app, so they have minimal options defined in them, and may have other special tweaks to work correctly in this context. But they should all work in regular Homebrew installations, too!

This tap lives at <https://github.com/octave-app/homebrew-octave-app>. Please report any bugs there.
